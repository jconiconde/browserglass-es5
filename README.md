# Browserglass

This is a web app that can be used for synchronized testing with different devices / platforms. It uses Browsersync & socket.io behind the scene. I hope you find it useful :)

*Note: This project is still under development and only works for some secured sites. I recommend to only use it internally (for testing perhaps :P ). I'm planning to migrate it to ES6 & Redux and consolidate a lot of stuff with new features that will be added .* 

### Tech

* node.js - evented I/O for the backend
* Express - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]

* Babel
* Browsersync
* Nodemon
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* REDIS
* Socket.io
* Browserify
* Sass
